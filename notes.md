I forgot about this project. I have to come back to it and make a full fledged website. Project is done but it has loading issues and no website for others to use. Should probably get on that after my face recognition project is done.

Current Issues:
All pokemon load in and this leads to having to scroll extremely far. Also takes super long to load in each separate "box" for each pokemon
